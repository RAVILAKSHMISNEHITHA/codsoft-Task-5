## Overview of the Project

### Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Objective**: Detect fraudulent credit card transactions effectively using machine learning.

**Key Activities**:
1. Preprocess transaction data, normalize it, and address class imbalance issues.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train classification models, e.g., logistic regression, random forests, or advanced methods like gradient boosting.
4. Evaluate performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Optimize results using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.

**Technologies**:
- Libraries: 'pandas', 'numpy', 'scikit-learn', 'matplotlib', 'seaborn'
- Platform: Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

**Key Insights**:
- Fraudulent transactions are rare, requiring careful handling of imbalanced datasets.
- Evaluation metrics like precision and recall are more critical than accuracy for detecting fraud.
- Robust preprocessing (e.g., removing noise and scaling data) significantly enhances model performance.
